## Process Taken to Scan Image

- Converting JPG image to RGB matrix format.
- Resizing RGB Image Matrix to 640 x 480 pixels.
    - Group of pixels are replaced by a single pixel with their mean value.
- Converting RGB Image Matrix to Grayscale Image matrix
    - Gray = (Red + Green + Blue) / 3

- Giving 1px black border on all four sides for calculation process.
- Detecting the Edges using CANNY EDGE DETECTION TECHNIQUE.
    1. Applying GAUSSIAN BLUR effect to Grayscale image to reduce noise.
    2. Finding Intensity Gradients of the image - Magnitude and Angle.
    3. Applying non-max suppression to the smoothened image using magnitude and angle.
    4. Double Threshold
    5. Edge Tracking by Hysteresis to process weak pixels.
